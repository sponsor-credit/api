# Sponsor Credit API

### Show appreciation to your sponsors

### Why did we make this?

GitHub sponsors is a major platform many developers use to fund their open source work, and many developers like to give credit to those sponsoring them through README file or other documents. GitHub sponsors does not provide an easy way of doing this, short of manually writing out sponsor names. This is what our project aims to fix, it provides an easy way to give credit to your GitHub sponsors through your README file, no extra configuration needed.
